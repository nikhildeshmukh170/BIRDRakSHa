## Project Overview

BirdRaksha is a machine learning-based project that leverages image processing techniques to identify bird species from images. By analyzing key features from bird photographs, BirdRaksha provides predictions on species classification and additional details about the birds, helping researchers, ornithologists, and bird enthusiasts in their efforts to monitor and protect avian wildlife.

The goal is to make bird species identification faster, more accurate, and accessible for non-experts.

## Features

- **Bird Species Classification**: Identify bird species from uploaded images.
- **Predictive Model**: Advanced machine learning model to predict bird species with high accuracy.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Automatically preprocesses images to improve prediction quality.
- **Interactive User Interface**: User-friendly web interface to upload images and view predictions.
- **Species Information**: Detailed information about the identified bird species.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing bird species data)
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Heroku for frontend and backend

## Dataset

BirdRaksha uses a custom-curated dataset of bird species images sourced from various repositories, including Kaggle and UCI, alongside publicly available datasets from bird conservation organizations.

The dataset includes:
- Image attributes such as bird species, habitat, color patterns.
- Cleaned and preprocessed for improved accuracy.
